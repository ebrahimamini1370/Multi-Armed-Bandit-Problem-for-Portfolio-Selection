# Multi-Armed-Bandit-Problem-for-Portfolio-Selection
In this project, we formulated the portfolio selection problem as a multi-armed bandit(MAB) problem. The resulted MAB problem can be solved with any bandit methods, and we used the epsilon-greedy method. After that, we evaulated the efficiency of the MAB approach for portfolio selection, in two different scenarios. In the first scenario, we evaluated the efficiency of the MAB approach on real financial data, and compared the resulted portfolio with a benchmark portfolio. In the second scenario, we evaluated the efficiency of the MAB approach in simulated financial data based on mathematical models. All in all, the observed results in this project, convinced us to think of the MAB approach as a method with high potential to solve the portfolio selection problem. For this reason, we will continue our journey in financial markets, and will try to make more complicated agents for portfolio selection, such as contextual bandits agents and reinforcement learning agents.


## Note
Throughout this project, my focus has been on simplifying the theoretical concepts and coding methods in order to make them easily understandable to anyone. For this reason, I have written the code parts in a very simple and comprehensible way, while in a professional environment, we can write the codes in a more professional manner.
